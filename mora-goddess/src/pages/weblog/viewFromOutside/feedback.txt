                    <p>Here we are, stepping into the sequel to the Inside View piece — but this time, we’re looking from the outside in. The story unfolds from the moment Yviira shared those intriguing screenshots from the web game, sparking the creative journey. Curious about how it all began? <a onClick={() => {setPageName("weblog-view-from-inside")}} className={Styles.LinkToWeblog}>Dive into the View from Inside here.</a> Let’s embark on this artistic adventure together!</p>

                    <h1>Establishing the layers</h1>
                    <p>Just like with the inside view, I started by placing the screenshot way back on a layer in Clip Studio Paint (CSP), then carefully traced the defining shapes across four separate layers. This screenshot really highlights the sense of distance, doesn’t it? Each of these layers comes with a clipping layer, where I locked pixels to paint in shades, volumes, and crisp edges — it’s like building the skeleton before adding the skin.</p>

                    <br/>
                    <p>Take a closer look at the slightly lighter patches here — these are the “shade” layers, adding depth and mood to the scene:</p>

                    <h1>Establishing the light</h1>
                    <p>Before diving into color, I needed to find the perfect lighting to breathe life and atmosphere into the scene. For this outside POV, I had the fun challenge of working with foliage leaves and factoring in the temple’s slightly off-center perspective. I imagined the light source resting on the horizon, casting warm light that highlights the temple’s walls and creates dramatic shadows from the trees. My first draft turned out a bit too moody for Yviira’s taste...</p>

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <p>So, I lightened things up by loosening the tree clusters and refining how the light plays across the scene. Without Blender or fancy 3D tools, I had to rely on good old-fashioned spatial intuition — a bit of a puzzle, but a rewarding one! This second draft got the green light:</p>

                    <h1>Adding colours</h1>
                    <p>Just like the inside view, I used level correction to gently nudge the layers away from greyscale toward harmonious colors that carry the atmosphere. With about 10 layers to work with, I blended soft sprays and brushes to introduce color without losing the delicate lighting I’d set up. A saturation filter sat on top, helping me double-check that the mood stayed intact.</p>
                    <img className={Styles.AddedPaintImageSize} src={AddedPaint} alt="couldn't load image"/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Even though the colors looked good under the saturation filter, the scene felt a bit empty — like something was missing. Time to sprinkle in the magic: floral elements, vines, and orchard fruits that Yviira requested. Inspired by Ross Tran’s playful “Ross Draws” sparkles, I added tiny dots on the fruit trees, scattered a few flowers, and dusted the whole scene with those whimsical fairy-dust-like sparkles. Instead of white dots on the light areas, I opted for a soft “Add Glow” brush (Color Dodge in Photoshop) to keep light and shadow beautifully distinct.</p>

                    <h1>Final touches</h1>
                    <p>To wrap it all up, I gave the piece one last loving pass with a level correction filter, pulling all the colors into a dreamy harmony so everything felt like it truly belonged together. Then, I popped it into Affinity Photo for some subtle chromatic aberration, a gentle Gaussian blur, and a sprinkle of noise — just enough to soften the image and give it that authentic, lived-in feel. I was proud of how it turned out, but most importantly, Yviira’s vision had come alive on the canvas:</p>
